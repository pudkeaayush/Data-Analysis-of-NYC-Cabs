# Data-Analysis-of-NYC-Cabs
A Big Data Analytics Project for NYC cabs

The data used is from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission website. The data can be downloaded from the following links:
1. https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2015-12.csv
2. https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2016-05.csv
3. https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2016-06.csv

Save the files in your current folder and then the code can be run provided you have spark installed on your system.
Simply running python code.py will suffice.
